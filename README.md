This is a repository to just quickly convert you json files from xoul ai to chub ai. Made this primarily for myself, but leaving it up for anyone else who also needs to still do this 2 months after xoul's shutdown. Right now it supports doing xouls one at a time. I am going to change it to allow conversion of lorebooks too and multiple xouls, hopefully by the end of today.

To use, just visit the attached vercel site. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at mahdmahdmalik@gmail.com


Ignore the stuff below.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
